        p>Hello all, thank you for taking the time to check out my blog! I'm very excited to be writing my first blog post ever. In this post I want to talk about golf. I love golf, it's really fun to get outside and be on the golf course, maybe even crack a couple of cold ones with the boys. There's no better feeling than hitting your driver pure off the face of the club and watching it go down the middle of the fairway. Or perhaps when you hit a beautiful putt that rolls end over end on the perfect line and drops perfectly in the hole. Golf, while fun, can be pretty frustrating. The thing that makes it the most frustrating is that you know you are capable of hitting a good shot, but doing that consistently is quite difficult for all players. The mid range shots are also one of the hardest to hit. Sure, anyone can rip their driver. But it's from 150 yards in that even pro players can struggle with. Anyways, I would like to share some of furhtest drives that I have been able to hit during this years amazing and beatuiful golf season. Even though the season is still not over it's close to being so.</p>
        
        <h3>Furthest drives</h3>
        <table>

                <tr>
                    <th>May</th>

                </tr>
            </thead>

                <tr>
                    <td>250 yards</td>
                    <td>269 yards</td>
                    <td>280 yards</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>273 yards</td>
                    <td>287 yards</td>
                    <td>293 yards</td>
                </tr>

                    <td>299 yards</td>
                    <td>310 yards</td>

        p>Hello all, this is my second blog post ever. To keep things relevant to the first blog post I still wanted to chat with you guys about golf. We can go more into depth about my golf game in this blog post. So I started golfing about 3 summers ago due to the covid-19 pandemic. The reason being is because at the time there was not really much of anything to do so I thought to myself "well what's one thing I can do by myself that involves me not being around anyone?" and that's when it came to me "I know! I can go golf!" I mean it's perfect, you are literally by yourself in the middle of a field outdoors. And that is what started my obsession with golf. I actually fell in love with the sport and was able to get a few buddies of mine to pick up the game as well. I even got a summer job at a nice golf course so I could play for free whenever I wanted too. Which is something I would reccomend to any young college or high school student that loves the game. Because golf can be a pretty expensive thing to do with rounds ranging anywhere from $30 to $100. Ouch, especially if you have to pay that a few times a week!</p>
